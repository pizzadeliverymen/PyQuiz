I am making a small quiz using tkinter as a python gui (because i've not used python gui elements before)
This is going to be a very tiny project as a test.

conversion.py is the basic tutorial that tkdocs gives (https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/firstexample.html)

quiz.py is a trivia-style quiz game that uses the Open Trivia Database RESTful API to get trivia questions
